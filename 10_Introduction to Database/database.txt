# Introduction to Databases

## What is a Database?

A database is an organized collection of structured data stored electronically. A Database Management System (DBMS) is the software used to create, manage, and interact with that data.

## Key Concepts

### Data vs. Information
- Data: Raw facts (e.g., `42`, `"Alice"`, `2024-01-15`)
- Information: Processed data with meaning (e.g., "Alice made 42 purchases in 2024")

### Types of Databases

| Type                      |        Description                |          Examples      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Relational (SQL)          | Data in tables with relationships | MySQL,PostgreSQL,SQLite|
| Document                  | Data stored as JSON-like documents| MongoDB, Firestore     |
| Key-Value                 | Simple key → value pairs          | Redis, DynamoDB        |
| Graph                     | Nodes and edges for relationships | Neo4j                  |
| Column-family             | Optimized for large-scale queries | Cassandra              |

## Relational Databases (Most Common)

Data is stored in tables (like spreadsheets):

| id | name  | age | city     |
|----|-------|-----|----------|
| 1  | Alice | 30  | New York |
| 2  | Bob   | 25  | Chicago  |

Key ideas:
- Table — a collection of rows and columns
- Row / Record — a single entry
- Column / Field — a specific attribute
- Primary Key — a unique identifier for each row (e.g., `id`)
- Foreign Key — a reference to a primary key in another table (links tables together)

## SQL Basics

SQL (Structured Query Language) is how you talk to a relational database.

--> Create a table:
CREATE TABLE users (
  id   INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  age  INT
);

--> Insert data:
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice', 30);

--> Query data:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25;

--> Update data:
UPDATE users SET age = 31 WHERE name = 'Alice';

--> Delete data:
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;

The four core operations are often called CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete.

## Important Database Concepts

ACID Properties (for reliable transactions):
- Atomicity     — all or nothing
- Consistency   — data stays valid
- Isolation     — transactions don't interfere
- Durability    — committed data is saved permanently

Normalization —> organizing data to reduce redundancy (e.g., don't store a user's city in every order row — store it once in a users table).

Indexes —> like a book's index; they speed up queries at the cost of extra storage.

## SQL vs. NoSQL — When to Use Which?

Use SQL when your data is structured, relationships matter, and consistency is critical (e.g., banking, e-commerce).

Use NoSQL when you need flexibility, massive scale, or unstructured/varied data (e.g., social media feeds, real-time apps).
