What it is?

Tailwind CSS is basically a ready-made styling toolbox for your website.

In simple words:
Tailwind CSS is a utility-based CSS framework that gives you small classes (like bg-blue-500, text-center, p-4) to style your website quickly without writing your own CSS file.

Why people love it:- Very fast to build UI.
                     No need to write long CSS.
                     Easy to customize
                     Looks clean and modern

Tiny example:- <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-500">Hello Tailwind</h1>

Super short:-
            Tailwind = shortcuts for CSS + super fast styling.
