What it is?

CSS is basically the makeup and styling of a webpage.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML —
like colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, layout, animations, borders, backgrounds… all the good-looking stuff.

Simple vibe:

HTML = structure (skeleton)
CSS = design (clothes + makeup)
JS = actions (brain)

Super short:- CSS makes your website look attractive and well-designed.
