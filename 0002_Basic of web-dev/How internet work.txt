How the Internet Works (easy version):

1. You type a website name (like google.com).
2. Your device asks a DNS server: “Hey, what’s the exact address (IP) of this website?”
3. DNS gives the IP → your device sends a request to that server.
4. The server receives your request, finds the data (page, image, video).
5. Server sends the data back to you → your browser shows the website.

Tiny example:- It’s like sending a letter. You write the name, post office finds the correct house, delivers it, and brings the reply back.
