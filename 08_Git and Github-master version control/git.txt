                                            Git & GitHub

Introduction to Git & GitHub
What is Git?
            • Git is a version control system used to manage and track changes in source code.
              It helps developers work together on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.
            • Git maintains a complete history of changes and allows reverting to previous versions when needed.
What is GitHub?
            • GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories.
            It offers tools for collaboration, issue tracking, and project management.
            • GitHub allows developers to share code and contribute to open-source projects.

Basic GitHub Terms

1. Installing Git
    Git can be installed on:
        • Windows
        • Linux
        • macOS
After installation, user identity is configured using username and email.

2. Repository
    A repository is a directory where Git tracks all files and changes.
Types of repositories
        • Local repository
        • Remote repository
Repositories contain commits, branches, and configuration files.

3. Branch
        • Branching allows developers to work on different features independently.
        • The default branch is usually called main or master.
        • Branches help avoid conflicts in the main codebase.

4. Commit
        • A commit represents a saved state of the project.
        Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the change.
        • Commits help track progress and identify changes.

5. Stage
        • The process of adding changes to the staging area before commiting.
        • Prepares changes to be commited to the repository.

6. Merge
        • Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another.
        • Merge conflicts may occur when the same file is modified differently.

7. Clone
        • Cloning creates a local copy of an existing remote repository.
        • It allows developers to start working on a project immediately.

8. Pull Request
        • A pull request is used to request merging changes into the main project.
        • It allows review and discussion before merging code.

9. Fork
        • Forking creates a personal copy of someone else’s repository on GitHub.
        • It is commonly used in open-source contributions.

10. Remote
        • It enables collaboration among multiple developers.
        • A remote repository is stored on a server such as GitHub.

11. Conflict
        • Occurs when changes from different sources overlap ang Git cannot automatically resolve them.
        • Request manual resolve.

Basic Git Commands
1. Configuration
        • Git config –global user.name “ Your Name”
        • Git config –global user.email “Your.email@example.com”
        • Git config --list
2. Creating a Repository
        • Git init
            o Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
3. Cloning a Repository
        • git clone <repo-url>
            o Copies an existing repository to your local machine.
4. Staging and Commiting Changes
        • git add <file_name>
        • git add .
            o Stages for commit.
        • git commit -m “Commit message”
            o Saves changes with a descriptive message.
5. Checking Status and Logs
        • Git status
        • Git log
        • Sowing working directory status and commit history.
6. Branching and Merging
        • git branch <branch-name>
        • git checkout <branch-name>
        • git merge <branch-name>
            o Creates, switches and merges branch.
7. Pushing and Pulling Changes
        • git push origin main
        • git push -u origin main
        • git pull origin main
            o Sends or retrieves changes from a remote repository.
8. Resolving Merge Conflicts
        • Conflicts occur when changes overlap.
        • Use git status to check conflicts files.
        • Manually edit files to resolve conflicts.
        • Stage and commit resolved files.

Working with GitHub
Creating a GitHub Repository
        • Go to GitHub and log in.
        • Click on New Repository.

Connecting Local Repository to GitHub
        • Git remote add origin <repository_url>
        • Git push -u origin main
