What is HTML?

HTML is basically the skeleton of any webpage.

In simple words:- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language used to create the structure of a website—like headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, forms, tables, etc.
Think of it like:- You build a house → HTML is the bricks and walls. CSS decorates it, JS makes it interactive.

Super short:-
            HTML = the basic structure of every webpage.
